# HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS
### Project Overview:

Welcome to the Hotel Booking Analysis project! This Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims to provide insights into various aspects of hotel bookings. The dataset used contains information for both city hotels and resort hotels, including booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, special requests, and more. By exploring and analyzing this dataset, we aim to answer several key questions related to hotel bookings:

- When is the best time of year to book a hotel room?
- What is the optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate?
- How likely is a hotel to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?
- What are the important factors that govern hotel bookings?
- Which hotel retains more number of guests?
- Among all room type which room type is most preffered by traveller?  and many more...
### Dataset:

The dataset used in this analysis includes booking information for both city hotels and resort hotels. It contains a wide range of features, such as:

- Booking dates (when the booking was made)
- Length of stays
- Number of adults, children, and babies
- Required no. of parking space by customers
- ADR (average daily rates) defined by dividing the sum of all lodging transactions by the total number of staying nights.
- Types of deposits make by the customer  and many more...


### Analysis Approach:

This project follows a structured approach to analyze the hotel booking dataset:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and summarizing key features of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
- Interpretation and Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and providing actionable insights based on the analysis.


The analysis will provide answers to the following questions:

- The best time of year to book a hotel room.
- The optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate.
- Factors influencing the likelihood of receiving a disproportionately high number of special requests.
- Important factors that govern hotel bookings.
  These insights can help stakeholders in the hospitality industry make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and customer service initiatives.
